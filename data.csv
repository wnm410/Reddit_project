0,"A new study of 100 hunter-gatherers cultures suggests team-based play fighting, found only in humans, builds up the skills used in lethal raiding, and team sports may have evolved because it improved the coordination and motor skills used in warfare.",1
1,"One man's bipolar symptoms have been linked to the lunar cycle. Typically, our circadian rhythm (biological clock) is linked to the sun, but this patient's circadian rhythm was also linked to the moon. Every new moon, he experienced insomnia and switched from a depressive episode to a manic episode.",1
2,"No evidence that moral reminders reduce cheating behavior, finds a new replication study (n=4,674). Scientists report they were unable to reproduce the results of a well-known study showing that people are less likely to cheat on a task after making a list of the Ten Commandments.",1
3,"The “chicken or egg” paradox was first proposed to describe the problem of determining cause-and-effect. Now, physicists show that, as far as quantum physics is concerned, the chicken and the egg can both come first. This is called `indefinite causal order’, as reported in Physical Review Letters.",1
4,"People who are more well-off were made happier buying experiences over material things (the “experiential advantage”) but this is not universal - the less well-off get equal or more happiness from buying material things, suggests a new study.",1
5,"More than a billion adults around the world are at risk of serious disease through lack of exercise, a study has shown. As a result, they faced an increased risk of heart and artery disease, Type 2 diabetes, dementia, and some cancers.",1

7,"Female monkeys have 'innate distrust' of their male counterpart, according to new study",1

19,Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter may have caused 8.9 million deaths in 2015 according to a new mortality model of outdoor particulate air pollution. These results suggest that particulates are an even more important population health risk factor than previously thought.,1
20,"Scientists 3D print photoreceptors on the inside of a spherical surface to mimic the human retina - thus providing an alternative to conventional semiconductor microfabrication, and could create a new class of sensors",1
21,New research sheds light on the relationship between genes and bone fracture risk - and suggests vitamin D supplementation is not likely to prevent fractures,1
